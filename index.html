            <li><b>3. </b>“It depends on how I am feeling - sometimes I set it to all the way dark if I want a crunchy piece, but if I’m making a sandwich I set it to the lowest.  Every occasion calls for a different toast setting.”</li>

            <li><b>1. </b> “I just like the big lever that puts the toast down.  It feels great to move it and I know my bread is getting toasted once I do it.”</li>

            <li><b>2. </b> “I pick it up and throw it on the plate … pretty simple.”</li>
            <li><b>3. </b> “Depends on the type of bread - sometimes I bring it right to the stove and throw the eggs on top, other times it goes right on the plate where I can add peanut butter.”</li>

            <li><b>2. </b> “I never really have this problem because I found a setting that always does me well.  Sometimes when toasting a frozen bagel I run into issues, so I just double toast in this scenario.”</li>
            <li><b>3. </b> “Since I am changing settings so often, I don’t have a reliable number, so sometimes I definitely do under-toast.  This can be frustrating because then I don’t know how long to put it in again to get the toast level I want.  Sometimes I forget about the toast on the second round and it burns.”</li>

        <p class = "lead mb-5"> A toaster is a simple yet important interface. Through storyboarding and persona creation, I came to two 
            essential conclusions about toaster designs.  <b>First,</b> a good toaster must accomodate for both toast aficionado's and 
            those who want a lazy morning.  The toaster I looked at in this project was simple to use, without sacrificing precision.  <b>Second,</b> I learned that a good toaster 
            should give strong tactical feedback. The users I interviewed were especially fond of the push down lever which assured them that the bread was being toasted.
